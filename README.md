**SDG 10** stands for **Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities**. It focuses on reducing inequality within and among countries by promoting social, economic, and political inclusion for all, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.

Here are the main targets of SDG 10:

1. **Reduce Income Inequality (10.1):** By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average, to reduce the income gap.
2. **Promote Social, Economic, and Political Inclusion (10.2):** Empower and promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, ensuring equal opportunities regardless of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic status.
3. **Ensure Equal Opportunity and Reduce Discrimination (10.3):** Adopt policies and practices that promote equal opportunity and reduce inequalities, including eliminating discriminatory laws and practices.
4. **Adopt Fiscal, Wage, and Social Protection Policies (10.4):** Implement fiscal, wage, and social protection policies that progressively achieve greater equality by addressing inequality of opportunities.
5. **Regulate Global Financial Markets (10.5):** Improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial markets and institutions, and strengthen their implementation to prevent financial crises and promote stability.
6. **Represent Developing Countries in Global Decision-Making (10.6):** Ensure enhanced representation and voice for developing countries in decision-making in global economic and financial institutions, giving them greater influence on global policies.
7. **Orderly, Safe, and Responsible Migration (10.7):** Facilitate orderly, safe, and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies.
8. **Special Assistance to Developing Countries (10.a):** Implement the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries, particularly least developed countries, in accordance with World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements.
9. **Foreign Direct Investment to Developing Countries (10.b):** Encourage official development assistance (ODA) and financial flows, including foreign direct investment, to states where the need is greatest, especially least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries.
10. **Reduce Transaction Costs for Migrant Remittances (10.c):** By 2030, reduce to less than 3% the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5%.

Achieving SDG 10 helps to address the root causes of inequality and ensures that all people have access to opportunities, resources, and rights, regardless of where they live or who they are. This contributes to more stable, peaceful, and inclusive societies.
